<content> HYDERABAD: The CBI, probing the multi-crore accounting scam in Satyam Computers today completed its arguments on the charges to be framed against 10 accused in the case.   CBI's Special Public Prosecutor K Surendra, who had last week began arguments before the XXI Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (ACCM), sought to frame charges against each accused and presented before the court documents and evidence in support of the charges.   Opposing the discharge petitions of prime accused and former Chairman of Satyam Computers, B  Ramalinga Raju, and nine other others, the  CBI counsel explained their role in committing the Satyam fraud.   Surendra argued that the 10 accused, who have been charged with criminal conspiracy, cheating, forgery and falsification of accounts in the agency's three chargesheets, fabricated records and documents in order to cheat the investors.   Magistrate BVLN Chakravarthi, after hearing the CBI's arguments, posted the matter to September 15 to enable the defence present its case prior to framing of charges.   The magistrate also asked the CBI counsel to provide a gist copy to the defence on CBI's allegations. </content>
