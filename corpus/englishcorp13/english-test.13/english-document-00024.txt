<content> MUMBAI:  Reliance Industries, India's most valuable company, on Friday announced multi-billion dollar investment plans in the power sector and said that it will supply natural gas to  Anil Ambani Group's power plants as and when they are ready.    RIL Chairman and managing director  Mukesh Ambani said the company was ready for a "big surge forward" and will use its strong finances for "inorganic" growth and new ventures including expansion of capacity to produce polyester.   Addressing company shareholders exactly five years to the day when he and his brother Anil split the Reliance empire created by their father Dhirubhai Ambani, Mukesh signalled his desire to end the feud with his younger sibling Anil.  </content>
