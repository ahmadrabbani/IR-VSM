<content> MUMBAI: Suspected underworld don Dawood Ibrahim gang member  Mustafa Dossa, who allegedly attacked extradited gangster  Abu Salem inside the  Arthur Road jail, today alleged that the injuries on Salem were "self-inflicted", a crime branch source said.   "During the preliminary questioning, Dossa alleged that Salem, with the help of his associates, injured self to falsely implicate me," said a source from the Crime Branch, probing the attack on Salem's injury case.   "Salem had tried to extort Rs 30 crore from me for a property related deal he had struck, Dossa alleged," the source said.   Following a special TADA court's permission yesterday, the crime branch today took the custody of Dossa and his associate Abdul Qayyum Sheikh, who will be produced before an Esplanade court in connection with the Salem attack case.   Forty two-year-old Salem, a key accused in the 1993 serial blasts and facing trial in this case, was allegedly attacked by Dossa and Sheikh with a sharp spoon on Saturday outside their barrack following a heated argument.   The next day, Salem was shifted to Taloja jail, while Dossa was transferred to the Thane Central prison for security reasons.   Salem has been lodged in the high-security Arthur Road jail in central Mumbai since his extradition from Portugal in 2005 and is facing trial in nine cases, including two murders. </content>
