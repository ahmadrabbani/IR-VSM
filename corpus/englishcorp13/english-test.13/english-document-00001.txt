<content> PUNE: NCP president  Sharad Pawar on Sunday said he had counseled the three Yadavs-Mulayam Singh, Laloo Prasad and Sharad- not to stall the passage of the Women Reservation Bill in the Lok Sabha as their views on the quota for OBC and minorities could be taken into consideration by the government.   "A combination of Yadavs has emerged to oppose the Bill. I had a talk with them. I told them that the bill could be amended to address their concerns in respect of OBC and Muslim women. A reduction in the proposed 33% reservation can be considered to arrive at a consensus", he said while speaking at the concluding session of NCP's two-day national conclave at Karla, about 50 km from here.   Pawar said he told the SP, RJD and JD(U) leaders that they had the right to present standpoint but that should not create hurdles in the smooth passage of the historical legislation. He said  Union finance minister  Pranab Mukherjee had already assured the  House that all parties would be taken into confidence by the government on the issue.   The NCP, he noted, had always been a consistent supporter of the Bill since its inception. </content>
