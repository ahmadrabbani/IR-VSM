<date>3-3-2010</date>
<content> MUMBAI: Seeking CBI inquiry into the murder of Talegaon-based  RTI activist  Satish Shetty, his brother today alleged that some big-wigs were involved in the case, whom "police can not touch".   "We have named these persons in the FIR...But state police can't touch them, even the superintendent of police is helpless," said advocate  Vijay Nahar, appearing for Sandip Shetty, Satish's brother.   The High Court had taken suo-motu notice of Shetty's murder in January in Talegaon. Shetty had unearthed many land scams using Right to Information Act, and before his death he had complained to police that he was receiving threats.   "Probe is being carried out in frivolous manner," advocate Nahar said today.   However, division bench of Justice F I Rebello and J H Bhatia only asked the police to continue the investigation, and asked Sandip Shetty to file affidavit regarding his misgivings about the probe.   Hearing has been adjourned for two weeks. </content>
