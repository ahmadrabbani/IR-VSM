<title>Maya backtracks on dalit cooks for midday meals </title>
<date>26-7-2010</date>
<content> LUCKNOW: After instances of midday meal (MDM) boycott by upper caste students as it was prepared by dalit cooks, the UP government appears to have suddenly gone soft on its pro-dalit, pro-Scheduled Caste agenda.   In a discreetly issued government order, on July 23, the authorities have changed the appointment rules of MDM cooks, replacing 'compulsory' appointment of SCs, STs and OBCs to the post according to the existing roster system, to "preference will be given" to members from these communities.   The new order, issued by secretary, basic education department, Jitendra Kumar, also says that widows, shelterless women and divorcees will be preferred in their appointment as  cooks for the MDM scheme.   Interestingly, the new order also makes room for the appointment of male candidates to the post of MDM cooks. However, these appointments will also be subject to the existing roster — first preference to Scheduled Castes, then tribes, followed by OBCs and shelterless. The order has also withdrawn the clause, present in the earlier order of April 2010, that the women appointed must be related to wards studying in the said schools.   Though issued with the aim of putting to rest protests from upper castes, the order appears little more than careful wordcraft of the  Mayawati government. Earlier, voices of protest emanated from students and their families in nearly two dozen villages in Kanpur Dehat, Etawah, Kannauj, and Kanpur. In some instances, parents allegedly stopped sending their wards to school as a mark of protest against the government's decision.   Certain sections have dismissed the move as nothing more than Mayawati's attempts to bridge the class divide ahead of the assembly elections scheduled to be held in 2012.  </content>
